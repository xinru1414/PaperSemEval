\begin{abstract}
This is an example document for a WiNLP 2017 submission. 
Submissions must follow the standard two-column format of the ACL 2017 proceedings and they must be submitted as a PDF file. Authors should use the style files from the conference web site (\url{http://acl2017.org/calls/papers/}).
All submissions are limited to 2 pages of content, with any number of additional pages allowed for references.
The deadline for submission is 11:59pm Pacific Standard Time on April 21, 2017. Submission will be electronic using the paper submission web page at \url{https://www.softconf.com/acl2017/winlp}.

Submissions will be peer reviewed in the double-blind format. Abstracts will be evaluated on relevance to the community; the presentation format (talk or poster) will be decided based on scientific merit and potential interest to a broad audience.

As our goal is to highlight contribution to the community from women and underrepresented minorities, we will consider anonymized 2-page abstracts of papers that were submitted to other venues or published elsewhere in the past year (i.e. after Jan 1st, 2016), though authors must indicate this at submission time.

The rest of the document contains placeholder text.
